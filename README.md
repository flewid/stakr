<h1>Staks - Personal Precious Metals Management Interface</h1>

This is a personal precious metals manager. You can add a variety of items in your 'stack' and mark them as sold, or lost, or even stolen. You can view graphs of your overall profit, loss, inclusive of shipping/freight charges, numismatic value and spot value. 

You can also use this in 'offline' mode in that you create your data, download a csv, and then delete it. Useful if you're paranoid and want to store all your data locally but use this for seeing graphs or modifying your stack easily. 

Currently supports Gold, Platinum, Silver, Paladium 

Takes daily metal prices from Yahoo.
